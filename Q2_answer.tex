% Now consider a complete monitoring system based on the sensor devices you
% designed in Q1.
% A) Describe the system architecture and motivate your design choices. Include
% a system diagram describing the full system and data flow from sensor device to analytics application.

% B) Discuss the role of analytics, including machine learning and forecasting, in
% your design. You should include the type of data to be processed and the location of data analytics within your system.
% something something about how we save power by having the nodes do the processing of data instead of sending a lot of data (tiny-ml)

% i. Which decisions or ratings do you assume to be of interest, based on your data analytics?

%    Does a higher acceleration indicate a higher risk of an accident?
%    Does a higher concentration of particulate matter indicate a higher risk of
%    health problems?
% ii. Could you imagine combining the sensor data with data from other
% sources to augment your analytics? Give examples of data sources and
% the analytics they could enhance.
% C) Discuss the scalability of your system. E.g. How would your system adapt to
% an increase in the number of sensor nodes, end-users, or the geographical
% distribution of these? What are possible bottlenecks in your system design,
% and how could they be addressed?
